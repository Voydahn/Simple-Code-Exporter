# 📦 Code Exporter

A PyQt5-based desktop application that helps you extract source code from a selected folder while allowing filtering by file extension, exclusion of ignored folders (like `.git`, `node_modules`, etc.), and dynamic preview of selected files. You can copy the extracted code to the clipboard or save it into a single text file.
